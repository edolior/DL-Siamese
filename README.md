# DL_Siamese

This assignment aims to predict the probability of facial recognition based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Face Recognition is the process of automatically locating parts of an image while localizing them by drawing a bounding matrix around their extent. This work is based on the article “Siamese Neural Network for One-Shot Image Recognition” by Gregory Kock et al. The implementation of the network is based on the one-shot approach that consists of a small dataset of few examples instead of using a large dataset consisting of millions of records to classify similar identities. A single example of a pair is observed each time to make a prediction for a test instance. Siamese network uses a supervised metric-based approach without any retraining and suits well for a one-shot solution verification task.
